üèß ATM Transaction Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI project is designed to analyze ATM transactions, focusing on cost analysis, revenue performance, uptime, and monthly transactions. The dashboard provides insights into the maintenance cost, revenue generation, and uptime performance of ATMs across different regions.

**The project consists of three major sections:**

Home Page - Provides an introductory visual of the project.

Overview Page - Displays monthly revenue, transactions, uptime, and revenue distribution by region.

Detail Page - Offers detailed insights such as revenue performance, transaction range, and gross profit percentage by ATM.

üìä Features

Cost Analysis: Shows the cost spent on ATM maintenance such as CRA, UPS AMC, Site Maintenance, and Spare Repairs.
Monthly Revenue and Transactions: Highlights the revenue and transaction counts for each month and their trend over the year.
Revenue Performance: Breaks down revenue performance based on transaction ranges and gross profit margins.
